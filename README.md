## ‚ú® About The Project

This project is an implementation of the electronic memory game "Simon." The challenge, proposed in a web development course, was to bring a static page (with HTML and CSS already provided) to life by creating all the game mechanics.

**My contribution was the complete development of the `script.js` file**. I was responsible for all the logic behind the game, including:

* Starting the game and generating the color sequence.
* Capturing and validating player clicks.
* Controlling the level progression.
* Implementing sound and visual effects.
* Managing the "Game Over" condition and restarting the game.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

My main focus was on:

* **JavaScript:** For the entire structure of the game's logic.
* **jQuery:** To simplify DOM manipulation and event handling.

The project also uses:
* **HTML5:** For the page structure (provided).
* **CSS3:** For the visual styling (provided).

## üöÄ Getting Started

As this is a static project, running it is simple.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/biancaseara/SimonGameChallenge.git](https://github.com/biancaseara/SimonGameChallenge.git)
    ```
2.  **Open the `index.html` file:**
    Navigate to the project folder and open the `index.html` file in any web browser.

Press a key to start playing!

## üß† What I Learned

This project was essential for practicing and deepening my knowledge in:

* **Programming Logic:** Structuring a game with states, sequences, and validations.
* **DOM Manipulation with jQuery:** Selecting elements (`$()`), adding/removing classes (`.addClass()`, `.removeClass()`), and manipulating text (`.html()`).
* **Event Handling:** Capturing mouse clicks (`.on('click')`) and key presses (`.keypress()`).
* **Array Management:** Handling the game and user sequences (`gamePattern`, `userClickedPattern`).
* **Asynchronous Functions:** Using `setTimeout` to create delays and control the game's pacing.
* **Audio Manipulation:** Playing sounds dynamically based on game actions.
